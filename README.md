Key Features:
- 🎬 Programmatic Video Generation
- 📊 Dynamic Data Visualization
- 🖼️ Frame Capturing and Rendering
- 🌐 Interactive API-Driven Content

The project showcases how modern web technologies can be combined to create sophisticated, data-driven video experiences using React, Remotion, and advanced web APIs.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **React** (v18.2.0): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Remotion**: React video rendering framework
- **Framer Motion**: Animation library for React
- **Beeceptor**: Mock API responses generator

## 🎬 Remotion Implementation

### Current Achievements with Remotion

This project leverages Remotion to create dynamic, programmatically generated video content with advanced features:

#### 1. Dynamic Data Visualization
- Uses Remotion's `useCurrentFrame` and `interpolate` hooks to create animated data presentations
- Implements staggered animations for data items
- Dynamically renders floating shapes with smooth, continuous motion

#### 2. Interactive Video Components
- `ApiVideo` component demonstrates real-time data fetching and video rendering
- Implements gradient backgrounds and animated overlays
- Creates responsive, frame-based animations

#### 3. Advanced Animation Techniques
- Utilizes mathematical transformations for shape movements
- Implements opacity and translation interpolations
- Creates complex, smooth animations using trigonometric functions

#### 4. Capture and Rendering Capabilities
- Implements frame capturing functionality
- Provides methods to observe and interact with Remotion canvas
- Supports dynamic content generation and rendering

### Key Remotion Features Demonstrated
- Frame-based animations
- Dynamic content rendering
- Programmatic video generation
- Smooth interpolation and transitions

### New Features Added
- **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Improved animations for data items with additional visual effects.
- **New API Integration**: Added support for a new API endpoint for fetching real-time data.
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized rendering performance for smoother playback.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added interactive elements and animations to improve user engagement.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to ensure seamless video rendering.

## 🧪 Testing and Mock Data

### Dummy API Data with Beeceptor

For testing and development purposes, this project utilizes [Beeceptor](https://beeceptor.com/) to generate mock API responses:

- **Purpose**: Simulate real-world API interactions without depending on live endpoints
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent and predictable test data
  - No external API rate limits or dependencies
  - Easy to configure and modify mock responses
  - Enables frontend development independent of backend readiness

#### How Beeceptor is Used
- Creates mock REST API endpoints
- Provides static JSON responses
- Allows rapid prototyping and testing of data visualization components
- Simulates various data scenarios for Remotion video rendering

**Example Mock Endpoint**:
```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Sample Item", "value": 100 },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Another Item", "value": 200 }
  ]
}
```
